# *To the reader* 

Welcome to the R package building helper *readme2pkg.template*!

Below, is a readme that provides steps for building a package.  This readme acts as a worksheet, checklist, and control document as functions used in package building are included within and can be used in advancing development.  

We'll use the `{readme2pkg}` helper package to send code chunks to different directories in the package.  

To install `{readme2pkg}`:

```

remotes::install_github("EvaMaeRey/readme2pkg")

```

# Part 0. Proposal

Proposing the {xxxx} package! 🦄 
<!-- (typical package introduction write up; but actually aspirational) -->

The goal of {xxxx} is to make ... easier.


Without the package, we live in the effort-ful world that follows 🏋:

```{r}
x <- 4

2*x

```

  
With the {xxxx} package, we'll live in a different world (🦄 🦄 🦄) where the task is a snap 🫰: 

Proposed API:

```

library(xxxxx)

xxxxx::times_two(x = 4)

```



# Part I. Work out functionality  🚧 ✅ 

Here is a function that will do some work...


```{r times_two}
times_two <- function(x){
  
  x*2
  
}
```


## Try it out

```{r}
times_two(4)
```


# Part II. Packaging and documentation  🚧 ✅ 

## Phase 1. Minimal working package

### Bit A. Created package archetecture, running `devtools::create(".")` in interactive session. 🚧 ✅


```{r, eval = F}
devtools::create(".") # Bit 1. 1X
### Bit 2a: dependencies to functions using '::' syntax to pkg functions 
usethis::use_package("ggplot2") # Bit 2b: document dependencies
readme2pkg::chunk_to_r(chunk_name = "times_two") # Bit 3: send code chunk with function to R folder
devtools::check(pkg = ".")  # Bit 4: check that package is minimally viable
devtools::install(pkg = ".", upgrade = "never") # Bit 5: install package locally
usethis::use_lifecycle_badge("experimental") # Bit 6: add lifecycle badge
# Bit 7 (below): Write traditional readme
# Bit 8: Compile readme
# Bit 9: Push to githup
# Bit 10: listen and iterate
```


### Bit 7. Write traditional README that uses built package (also serves as a test of build). 🚧 ✅ 

The goal of the {xxxx} package is to ...

Install package with:

```
remotes::install_github("GithubCoolUser/mypacakge")
```

Once functions are exported you can remove go to two colons, and when things are are really finalized, then go without colons (and rearrange your readme...)

```{r, eval = F}
library(mypackage)  ##<< change to your package name here
mypackage:::times_two(10)
```

## Phase 3: Settling and testing 🚧 ✅ 

### Bit A. Added a description and author information in the [DESCRIPTION file](https://r-pkgs.org/description.html) 🚧 ✅

### Bit B. Added [roxygen skeleton](https://r-pkgs.org/man.html)? 🚧 ✅

### Bit C. Chosen a [license](https://r-pkgs.org/license.html)? 🚧 ✅

```{r, eval = F}
usethis::use_mit_license()
```


### Bit D. Settle on [examples](https://r-pkgs.org/man.html#sec-man-examples).  Put them in the roxygen skeleton and readme. 🚧 ✅

### Bit E. Written formal [tests](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-basics.html) of functions and save to test that folders 🚧 ✅


That would look like this...

```{r test_calc_times_two_works, eval = F}
library(testthat)

test_that("calc times 2 works", {
  expect_equal(times_two(4), 8)
  expect_equal(times_two(5), 10)
  
})
```


```{r, eval = F}
readme2pkg::chunk_to_tests_testthat("test_calc_times_two_works")
```




### Bit F. Check again. Addressed notes, warnings and errors. 🚧 ✅


```{r, eval = F}
devtools::check(pkg = ".")
```

## Phase 4. Promote to wider audience...  🚧 ✅ 

### Bit A. Package website built? 🚧 ✅


### Bit B. Package website deployed? 🚧 ✅

## Phase 5: Harden/commit: Submit to CRAN/RUniverse 🚧 ✅ 

# Appendix: Reports, Environment

## Description file complete?  🚧 ✅

```{r, eval = F}
readLines("DESCRIPTION")
```

## Environment  🚧 ✅

Here I just want to print the packages and the versions

```{r}
all <- sessionInfo() |> print() |> capture.output()
all[11:17]
```

## `devtools::check()` report

```{r, eval=F, error = T, results="hide", warning=F}
devtools::check(pkg = ".")
```

## Package directory file tree

```{r}
fs::dir_tree(recurse = T)
```
